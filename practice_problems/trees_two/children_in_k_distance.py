‚ùì PROMPT
Given a binary tree, a target node, and integer k, return an array of all children that are k distance away from the target node.

Example(s)
           1 <--- root
    2            3
 4     5      6     7
8 9  10 11  12 13 14 15

allChildrenKDistance(root, 2, 2) == {8,9,10,11}
allChildrenKDistance(root, 6, 1) == {12,13}
 

üîé EXPLORE
List your assumptions & discoveries:
- if the target node is not present, return an empty array
- if there are no children k distance away, or no children of target node period, return an empty array
- input of None should also return an empty array
- k distance is measured by level essentially, so 1 distance we would just return it's children
- assuming that there's only one target
 

Insightful & revealing test cases:
 

üß† BRAINSTORM
What approaches could work?
Algorithm 1:
Time: O(n) - iterating through our tree
Space: O(n) - output will be size of our tree in worst case

- we'll definitely iterate through the tree - DFS or BFS? I think BFS since we're finding the distance between nodes, and this way we won't go farther than needed
- we'll also need to keep track of a distance / level variable, that will start when we reach our target, and stop when we reach the given distance
- we'll be creating an array to store the children k distance away, potentially of size n, so
 

üìÜ PLAN
Outline of algorithm #: 

- if root is none we can return an empty array
- using BFS so we'll define a queue with the root in it
- we'll also define a result array
- while we have a queue:
    - have a level variable
    - pop out of the queue
    - if value of node is target:
        - we'll save that level
    - check if current level - k = saved level:
        - add value to output array
    - if current level > saved level + k:
        - return early
    - add left and right to queue
- return results

üß™ VERIFY
Run tests. Methodically debug & analyze issues.
