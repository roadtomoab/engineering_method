3 Levels to Algorithm Mastery
1. Understanding the Base Algorithm
    - Sort problems by topic
    - Sort by difficult, easy -> hard
    - Grind out the easy questions and try to understand them as much as you can.
    - Look at the discussion/solution to get clarity if stuck.
2. Identifying Algorithm in Questions
    - For every question you do in the above section, go to the left tab and look at the "Similar Questions" section.
    - Do every question within 1-level-higher of the similar questions.
    - Really look at the question, and try and find hints to affirm that the algorithm you used previously applies to this question.
3. Modifying Algorithm for Specific Questions
    - As you do the above questions, solve the question utilizing your previous solution and change the pieces that need to be changed.
    - Recommend NOT looking at the solution/discussion until you feel like you're at the point of (mental/emotional) failure

Study Guide:
- Copy/Paste the Question and Implementation
- Write a paragraph summary in human-readable format explaining the solution
* Keep track of the questions that you didn't do well on
    - Come back to that question a week later
A week before any of your big interviews, allocate time to do questions filtered by company/frequency
    - These will have questions you'll most likely getsa
    - You should be more comfortable around questions like this, that you haven't seen before
    - And you'll get more exposure around those questions
    - NOTE: I got a shit ton of those most-frequent questions in my interviews
