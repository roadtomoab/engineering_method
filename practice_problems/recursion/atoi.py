❓ PROMPT
Given a base-10 integer as a string, parse the integer and return it as an int. 
This problem can be done iteratively and recursively, and it's worth doing both! 

Example(s)
atoi("123") == 123
atoi("4") == 4
atoi("007") == 7
atoi("-1") == -1
 

🔎 EXPLORE
List your assumptions & discoveries:
- string won't be empty
- negative will be in front
- have to deal with negative sign seperately?

What approaches could work?
Algorithm 1:
- iterative approach
Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
 

📆 PLAN
Outline of algorithm #:
- convert to string using built in function
 

🛠️ IMPLEMENT

def atoi(intAsString: str) -> int:
 

🧪 VERIFY
Run tests. Methodically debug & analyze issues.
